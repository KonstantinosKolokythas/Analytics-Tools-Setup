# Anaconda & Jupyter Setup

Anaconda and Jupyter are becoming basic tools in the world of data science and data analytics. Below is a list of basic information for installation for the both of them along with simple explanation of the project's purpose.

## Anaconda

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Package versions in Anaconda are managed by the package management system conda.

## Jupyter

Project Jupyter is a project and community whose goal is to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages". Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are **Ju**lia, **Py**thon and **R**, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Supported browsers are the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome & Safari.
