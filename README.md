## Data analytics, tools, importance and future

Data analytics examines large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. Today's software tools enable the analyst to do the job better than ever, faster and with the best accuracy possible. The rapid advance of information technology means that those tools evolve, specialize and adapt to the needs of the business, making the "science of data" the most important innovation of the 21st century.
